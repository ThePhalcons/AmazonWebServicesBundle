Amazon Web Services Bundle
==========================

Overview
--------
This is a Symfony 2 Bundle for interfacing with Amazon Web Services (AWS).

This bundle uses the [AWS SDK for PHP](http://github.com/amazonwebservices/aws-sdk-for-php) by loading the SDK, and enabling you to instantiate the SDK's various web service objects, passing them back to you for direct use in your Symfony2 application..

For installation, configuration, and usage details, please see [`Resources/doc/README.md`](https://github.com/Cybernox/AmazonWebServicesBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/README.md)

Example Use Cases
-----------------
1. Connect to, and manipulate, any of the available Amazon Web Services, such as EC2, SQS, CloudFront, S3, etc.

2. Utilize Amazon S3 and CloudFront as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for a Symfony 2 application.
